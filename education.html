    <h1 style=" font-size: 30; font-style: italic;"> KINDERGARTEN </h1>
    At the age of <i>5 to 6</i>, I entered <small>kindergarten</small>. The name of my kindergarten is <small>Tadika An-Nur Bestari</small>. In the kindergarten, I found many friends and I was very happy to be able to play with them. My kindergarten has also provided a lot of upstairs games. For example, provide special playgrounds for children, clay, dolls and so on. So, until now I still remember what was in the kindergarten.

    <h1 style=" font-size: 30; font-style: italic;"> PRIMARY SCHOOL</h1>
    Next, when I was <i>7 to 12</i> years old, I went to primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Udang <abbr title="Sekolah Kebangsaan Sungai Udang">sksu</abbr>. At that school, I met a lot of friends during kindergarten. So, I'm not too scared to be friends with them. Apart from sksu school, I also went to a religious school, Sekolah Rendah Agama Kampung Delek, Klang. Religious school is not far from my house. Sometimes I ride a bike and even just walk.

    <h1 style=" font-size: 30; font-style: italic;"> SECONDARY SCHOOL</h1>
    By the age of 13 to 17, I went to school at <b>SMK (P) Methodist, Klang </b> <abbr title="SMK P Methodist Klang">(MGS)</abbr>. Just like before, there are many of my friends who go to the same school as me. My high school had very strict rules. This is because the school wants to produce excellent and disciplined students. Even though the rules of this school are strict, I still love this school. It is due to the many facilities provided in my school.

    Then, after finishing school, I got an offer to continue studying at Kolej Tingkatan Enam Sri Istana, Klang. I had accepted an offer to study there, however, my studies there were only a few months away. This is because soon after, I got an offer to do a Pre-Diploma at Uitm Lendu, Alor Gajah. So, I have continued to study at Uitm Lendu in the field of business in 2018.

    Finally, in 2019 until now, I have studied at Uitm Rembau and majored in information management. I am very happy to study at Uitm Rembau because there are many things I learned. Besides, I also have a lot of friends there. Even though I didnâ€™t enter the class physically, I was still crowded with all my classmates. We also often meet outside due to the fact that we live in one state.
