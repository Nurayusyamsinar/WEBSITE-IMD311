<hr>
    Here, I would like to tell you about my experience together with my family while on vacation. Before the existence of the covid-19 virus in this world, my family was kind of like to go for a walk. So, there were a lot of <big>sweet experiences</big> going on back then.
    There are many places we have visited. Among the places we often vacation are in Cameron Highlands and also Penang. Although our vacation did not take long, it meant a lot to us because we could spend time together and be able to create happiness in the family.

<p>

    Apart from that, I also had a <small>horror experience</small>h while I was studying at Uitm Lendu. Among the stories is that my roommate is often harassed and hysterical. It can be said that as long as I sat with him, I was very scared of the situation around me. Moreover, I am a coward.
</p>

<p>
    So, that's all a little bit of my <b>experience</b> with regards to sweet experiences as well as horror. Thank you!
